                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kamal (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)</b>
                    This was stated by visionary Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the 11th President of India at a jam-packed
                    hall in
                    Kolkata on January 2, 2003 when he inspired thousands of school children to dream, to dream big, and
                    let
                    those dreams culminate in thoughts and actions. “Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it
                    is
                    something that does not let you sleep,” the ‘people’s President’ had elaborated later.
